Capstone - Project Proposal
	For my Capstone Project I am proposing a fitness app where users can enter their fitness goals and information about their own fitness levels and receive a workout routine based on their responses. The goal of this app is to give folks that are new to fitness/strength training and donâ€™t know where or how to start, a program tailored to their own goals as well as detailed information about exercises, basic nutrition advice, and other resources and recommendations that can help them on their journey.
	The data that I plan on using to create this app are as follows: 
Categories of muscle groups, exercises that benefit/target those muscle groups, specific strength training equipment, exercises that can be done using specific strength training equipment, detailed summaries of each exercise and how to conduct them with proper form, recommendations on the amount of volume to be used for specific muscle groups and exercises, and basic information regarding macronutrients.
	A rough outline of my database schema would include tables of:
Users, and their personal information such as height, age, weight, fitness goal, available equipment; Equipment types/availability, such as dumbbells-only, full gym setup, no equipment, etc.; Exercises, including the muscle groups that they work, summary of the exercise, tips on how to perform exercise, and equipment needed to perform exercise, etc,; Workout programs, and their recommended volume of work, recommended sets/reps per exercise, and basic nutrition advice.
	Issues that may arise with the API that I choose to work with are not having all the data that I would like to have available specifically relating to exercise summaries and technique.
	I believe the only information that I may need to secure would be user information such as their name, age, and email. No other personal or sensitive information would be required by users to use the app.
In my app users will be able to register and log in to their accounts, they will be filling out forms and will have their responses stored in the DB, users will be able to view their workout programs and input their progress in a dashboard, edit and delete their programs as they wish, have multiple workout programs stored in their account, and have a section of resources that would link to videos and articles to help with technique and general fitness and strength training theory.
A stretch goal that I have would be to eventually create a feature where trainers can submit their own training programs and tips and users can subscribe to them via a paid subscription.
